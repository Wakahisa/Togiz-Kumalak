Game description:

Togiz Kumalak is a mancala game played in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan with the variant of a capture cup on each player's side.

Each player has 9 cups starting with 9 balls in each along with a winnings area.

Game Rules:

Players take turns, and on each turn, you as a player can pick up the seeds from any cup on your side. 
If there is only one seed in a cup, you can pick that one up. If there is more than one seed, then you pick up all but one.
You then drop the seeds one-by-one in each cup, moving counterclockwise around the board.

If a cup has an even number of seeds in it, it is referred to as closed. If it has an odd number in it, it is referred to as open.
If the last seed you drop is into one of your opponent's cups which is open, you win all of the seeds in that cup.

The overall strategy is to open your opponent's cups by leaving an odd count in them, and to close your own by 
leaving an even count in them.

If the last seed on a play is dropped into one of your opponent's cups with 2 seeds in it, this cup becomes what is referred to as 
your home on the opponent's side of the board. You immediately win the 3 seeds in that cup and for all following play, any seed 
that goes into that cup, whether one played by you or your opponent, goes into your winnings. A player can only have one home,
so after getting one, the usual rules apply to cups with 2 seeds in them. They are cups with an event count. Both players can have
a home. The fact that one player has one doesn't prevent the other from getting one. On a physical board, a cup that has become
a home is usually marked with a special game piece that is different from the regular ones.

Play ends when one player runs out of seeds on his side of the board. When this happens the player with seeds remaining gets to
add them to his winnings. The player with the most seeds wins.
